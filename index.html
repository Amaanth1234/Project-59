        <p>My hobby is to read books.I mainly read adventure, thriller and mystery books. I read such books as they are usually very interesting. They have lots of suspense and unexpected twists and turns. I also read books about mythology. Some of my favorite mythology books are written by Rick Riordan. They are also very interesting as they combine the mythological world and the real one almost perfectly.</p>

            <p>The main chracter of this book is Dr. John Dolittle. He loves animals and had several pets who lived with him and his sister Sarah Dolittle. He is taught the language of animals by his pet parrot, Polynesia. He decided to become an animal doctor. Once, he met a crocodile who had escaped from the circus. He didn't have the heart to return the crocodile so he kept it.<br> But, the people had stopped sending their pets for fear that the crocodile might eat them. Everyday, the doctor had less and less money.He heard from his monkey that monkeys in Africa were dieing of a strange disease. The doctor, with some of his pets, set sail for Africa.<br> Upon reaching Africa, they were met by the King's men who captured him and brought him to the king, who imprisoned him. Polynesia conconted a plan to free them. Now free, they headed to the monkeys. The doctor asked for help from the lions and cheetahs. With their help, Doctor Dolittle cured the monkeys.<br>
                As way of thanks, the monkeys gave him a pushmi-pullyu- a strange, two-headed goat. When he sailed back, people paid him money to see the pushmi-pullyu. Soon, the doctor was rich again and lived happily ever after.
